# Poker Hand Classification Using XGBoost

This project focuses on classifying poker hands based on their card combinations using a machine learning model, specifically XGBoost. The dataset used is encoded into an 85-bit representation to capture card suits and ranks, and the classifier predicts the class of poker hands.

## üìÅ Dataset

### Datasets Used:
1. **Training Data:** `poker-hand-training-true.data`
2. **Testing Data:** `poker-hand-testing.data`

### Dataset Columns:
The dataset contains 11 columns:
- **Card1_Suit, Card1_Rank, ..., Card5_Suit, Card5_Rank:** Suit and rank of the 5 cards.
- **Hand_Class:** Integer representing the type of poker hand.

## üîß Project Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `xgboost`
  - `matplotlib`

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìú Code Overview

### Steps:
1. **Data Loading**  
   - The training and testing datasets are loaded using `pandas`.

2. **Feature Encoding**  
   - Card suits and ranks are encoded into an 85-bit representation using one-hot encoding.

3. **Data Splitting**  
   - The training dataset is split into training and validation sets (80/20).

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**  
   - Class weights are calculated dynamically to address imbalances in hand classes.

5. **Model Training**  
   - XGBoost is used with specific parameters to train the model.  
   - Early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset using a classification report and confusion matrix.

7. **Feature Importance Visualization**  
   - The top 10 important features are visualized using XGBoost's built-in plotting function.

## üöÄ Running the Project

1. **Run the script**  
   Ensure the dataset files (`poker-hand-training-true.data` and `poker-hand-testing.data`) are in the same directory as the script.
   ```bash
   python poker_hand_classification.py
   ```

2. **Output**  
   - **Classification Report:** Metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.  
   - **Confusion Matrix:** A matrix to evaluate prediction accuracy for each class.  
   - **Feature Importance Plot:** Top 10 most important features influencing the model's predictions.
